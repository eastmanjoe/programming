NOTES on future programming

- Pyranometer Type selection (POA and Horiz)
	* Select Case/EndSelect use the name of the sensor to select the appropiate multiplier calculation

- Functions
	* Use to allow a single function by passing in variables
	* Need to determine how to return multiple values
	* Could be used for:
		# Inverters
		# Meters
		# Back-Of-Module Temperature Sensors
	
- Ambient Temperature selection
	* Select Case/EndSelect to select proper sensor type using name
	
- WindVector Command

- Code Re-organization
	* Seperate to the lowest component, NOT to configurations
	* i.e. Code for pyranometers is written in almost every S and E component file.  Hard to make sure any updates are captured in all components
	
- Repetitions
	* Data Table

- Therm107, Therm108, Therm109 CANNOT be used inside conditional statements, if program is run PipeLine Mode
	* But can be put inside conditional compilation statments
